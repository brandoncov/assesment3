// 1. Fix this code to make it check if a number is less than 10. Return true if the number is less than 10, and return false if it is greater than or equal to 10. Assign the return value of this function to our constant named testValue.

// 3. Create a Person class with properties for name, age, height, and weight. Create two functions within this class, one called eatFood and the other called exercise. The eatFood method should add weight to our person object, and the exercise method should subtract weight from our Person object.

        var name: String
        var age: Int
        var height: Double
        var weight:Double

// 4. Create an Athlete subclass that inherits from our Person class. Add properties for sport and team.

// BONUS: Create a recursive function (a function that calls on itself) that will take a number as a parameter and print each number as it countdowns from that number until we reach 1.
